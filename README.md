# CRISPRmap analysis
This repository is for the deposit of scripts used in CRISPRmap image (and sequencing) data analysis only.

1. Split probe: design RNAmap Padlock and Primer pairs based on sepcific transcript sequences

2. T-cell & melanoma cell interaction analysis: identify melanoma cell-interacting T cells based on cell membrane and nucleus segmentation of a co-culture system

3. Micronuclei detection in DNA damage repair (DDR) studies: detect micronuclei via spot calling using nucleic acid staining

4. DDR foci quantification: detect DDR foci (and micronuclei) via spot calling and assign foci to corresponding cell masks

5. BFP-GFP mix CRISPRmap amplicon detection & decoding: CRISPRmap amplicon detection & decoding for BFP-GFP assay

6. NGS library guide-barcode recombination analysis: quantification of guide-barcode recombination rate for CRISRPmap libraries at oligo pool, plasmid, genomic DNA levels via NGS reads analysis
